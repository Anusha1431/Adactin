# Postman_collection

I'm actually trying something new, you can share a collection from your Postman client and add a "Run in Postman" button to a site, it's the first time that i'm giving it a go so let me know if it doesn't work.

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/13ccbf4d4178225a373f)

Alternatively, you can just grab the collection .json file from this repo and manually import this on your machine.
